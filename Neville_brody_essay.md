*Neville Brody* The Designer with no Boundries?
-----------------
By Hayley Mcilwrath

### Introduction

"People think that digital language is a fixed language, but it’s not. It’s very fluid. It’s like I’m doing a painting where the paint refuses to dry"

For this essay I am discussing my chosen designer Neville Brody and taking a timeline through his life's work. I will summarise the topics, styles, genres, artists and designers that influenced him.  I will show how I have then used this designer to influence my own portfolio.

Choosing one designer from the list provided was extremely hard. I completed research on each of the designers and felt a particular connection with two; Neville Brody and Jessica Hitche.

I admire Jessica Hitche's work and enjoyed looking at her typography skills and tattoo designs.The image below highlights the intense details she puts into each letter, each one is an individual piece of art work.

I continued my research with the designer Neville Brody. Brody’s work stood out for three reasons; his personality, his link to my own work and his eccentric mood on his works of art. For this assignment I hope to capture each of these areas to show what inspired me.

The Man himself
=====================

Brody is perhaps known to be the best graphic designer of his generation. His work in the 1980’s revolutionised the look of magazines, advertisements, album covers and packaging. He is most well known for his ground-breaking design and typography for the magazine ‘The Face'

(add more about his personal interests)

Where did it begin?
=====================

> " I dont remember a time in my life when I was going to be doing something else. Ever since I had any self awareness, I've wanted to do art or painting."

From an early age Brody was very sure of what he wanted to do in life. His studies reflected this starting with A level art and continuing on to do a foundation course in Fine Art at Hornsey  Art College. During his time here he came to realise that;

> "I wanted to understand the everyday images that where around me at that time, and the process of manipulation particularly with in  commercial art. By understanding the mechanism at ground level, I hoped to produce the opposite effect by turning them on their head."


This influenced him to choose the route of graphic design rather than the Fine Art were that world was become elitist. If he continued in this area his work would have found a limited audience. I feel this decision was what made him what the designer he is today. If he had of stayed within Fine Art he wouldn't have the personality and be as eccentric within his work. Brody continued his studies and pursued a 3 year B.A course in Graphic design at the London College of Printing. This is were it all began!

What really influenced him?
===================

### Punk


Punk hugely inspired Brody as he quotes;

> "Punk was probably the
most influential thing to happen to me"

In 1977, When Brody was studying Graphics, Punk was starting to take a major effect upon London's life. As far as Brody was concerned this give him the jump start he needed and the confidence to start ti experiment with punk through his own work.

Wires Pink Flag was "what really did it for me", was the starting point into Brody's inspiration. There advice which Brody quotes;

> You should pursue an idea, do it, stop, then go on to the next one.

As Brody embraced the punk era and started designing is own artwork they didn't go down well and he was nearly thrown out at one stage. He designed the Queens head onto a postage stamp only he put the head side ways and this was hugley frowned upon.

### Dadaism

In spite of the postage stamp, Brody was not only motivated by the energy and rebelion of punk. His first year thesis had been based around a comparison between Dadaism and pop art.

Although it was said that in a certain sence, Art died with Dadaism Brody though it was 'anti-art' and was probably the most artistic of any intervention of its century and influenced much of his work

### Futurism

Futurism was also influenced apon Brody's work and Boccioni was a huge inpsiration to him. His work is colourful and connects to the colour studies in Brody's own work.

Looking at Boccioni's work they used collage, cut-up newspapers, mad colour or found objects to create radical, chaotic images. Things
you previously knew or understood were turned upside down and all rules were
broken and this radical approach
influenced Neville Brody.


### Pop Art

Pop art was very close linked with punk but it was a very commercial art and was presented in a way that made anti-commerical art acceptable at this time.

Andy Warhol's Andy Warhol was the superstar of the Pop Art and his Marilyn Monroe made him famous worldwide. Brody said 'his art was subversive for about fifteen minutes' as he blended unlike elements together and this is what made his Pop Art so successful and brody tookimpsiration from this.

His work and style
===================

When studying at the London College of Printing, Brody got his first taste of a musical movement that was to have a heavy influence on his future work.

Everyone knows Brody for typography and with his heavy influence on music, I think this is what makes his work so fluid and exciting to look at. He thought to himself that people read magazines to look at rather to absorb the knowledge like a book which I agree with. I myself would buy a magazine to view rather than to read. Brody thought that viewers would flick back and forth to the interesting bits that caught his attention. Brody decided to use this idea as a basis for his designs.

He took this into consideration and he focused on the main content he wanted readers to see first and did this by contrasting sizes, shapes or colours of type. He did this to highlight the main parts of the article and attract their attention.

### The Face


This brings me “The Face” magazine. In his designs for the “The Face” magazine, he arranged the typography in shapes such as cirlces. He made some letters extra large, some really small. This made the letters never look the same which was a style of Brodys.

Instead of page numbers he used symbols and to separate the different topics. he used little logos to separate the article and this give it a unique style and a house style. He also designed a new font uniquley for the magazine. It was simple with no serifs. It was modern as it had curved ends.

Brody decided that the typography should be emphasised as he believed it had an equal importance to the magazine. The style of lettering should be used to illustrate the
article as well as the image to have the same impact. This was very
unusual at this time.


As the years progressed Brody developed his typeface to include interesting details such a
symbols, signs and more unusual punctuation marks, all of this attention to detail
helped make ‘The Face ‘ the most fashionable and influential style magazine of the
late 20th Century.


The Crazy Fuse Fonts
--------------------

"Fuse has always been a battleground of experimentation and a laboratory of thought."

Fuse has always been edging continually between familiarity and abstraction

How he influenced me?
=====================

Brody's work as hugely inspired me and influenced me in many ways. The main influence he as given me is the confidence to go crazy in my work. that there is no limit and going a little mad is okay and can reflect hugely on your work.
