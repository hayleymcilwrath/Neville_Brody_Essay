 <p class="welcome"> 
     
<b>Uncommon Knowledge</b> also known as UKN is shaped in many ways; one of which is to keep the beards looking groomed and slick!
     
<p>Our goal is to provide a brand that attracts all age ranges to want to learn and gain more skills on how to be awesome. </p>
     

<p><b>Why are these important?</b>
    
Brand guidelines help to maintain a consistent look so that consumers and employees understand the brand. These guides help to show our personality and by the end hopefully you will know us and the beard a bit better. </p>

  <h2> LOGO</h2> 
        </section>
           
           <section class= "white">
   <p id='logo'> Our logo is an important asset to our brand and was developed to be modern and unique. It is a distinctive mark and has to be took into consideration what way it is presented. Therefore we beg you, <em>don't mess with the chin curtain!</em>
       
<p>The logo</p>
           
           <img class="main-logo" src="images/the-logo.png" />
               
<p>The logo also needs room to breathe as we don't want text or other media elements messing with our beard, theres fore we need to have enough white space around our logo;</p>
               
               

     <img class="white-space" src='Images/space-logo.png' />
           
<p>The logo comes in didn't colour forms. We have the idea when the webpage is refreshed each time the logo changes colour. This will also result in the icons and other important content changing colour. </p>
    
    
           <img class="horizontal" src="images/logo-horizontal.png" />
           
<h3><b>Do's and Dont's</b></h3>
           
<p>You wouldn't shave half your beard and leave the rest? so take a moment to think about how to apply the Uncommon Knowledge logo and be nice to it. Below is how not to use our logo;</p>
